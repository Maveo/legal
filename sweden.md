## 🏢 Company Types That Can Offer Equity

In Sweden, only one type of business structure can issue actual shares:

### ✅ **Aktiebolag (AB) – Limited Liability Company**
- Required if you’re being granted equity.
- Comes in two forms:
  - **Privat AB (Private AB)** – Most common for startups.
  - **Publikt AB (Public AB)** – For large companies, often publicly traded.
- Must be registered with **Bolagsverket** (the Swedish Companies Registration Office).
- Equity should be formalized via a **shareholders’ agreement** and cap table entry.

### 🚫 Cannot Issue Shares
- **Enskild firma** (sole trader)  
- **Handelsbolag (HB)** (general partnership)  
- **Kommanditbolag (KB)** (limited partnership)  
> If the company is one of these, any equity promises are informal and not backed by legal shares.
