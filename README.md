## 🔍 What to Look Out For

### ✅ 1. Company Structure – Can it Issue Shares?
- Only certain legal business types can offer real equity.
- Make sure the entity is (or will be) able to legally grant you ownership.
- If it’s not yet registered, push for formal setup before promises of equity.

### ✅ 2. Clear Vesting Schedule
- Insist on a written vesting schedule.
- Common setup: **4 years with a 1-year cliff**
- Avoid vague terms like "you’ll get X% after launch"

### ✅ 3. Define Your Role and Deliverables
- Outline exactly what you’re contributing (e.g. design, dev, marketing).
- Get it in writing what counts as “completed” or “fulfilled.”

### ✅ 4. Get It In Writing
- Ask for a **Shareholders’ Agreement**, **Letter of Intent (LoI)**, or **Sweat Equity Agreement**.
- Key things it should include:
  - Your % ownership
  - Vesting terms
  - Buyback or exit clauses
  - What happens if either party leaves

### ✅ 5. Protect Your Vested Shares
- If you leave or are let go, **vested shares should remain yours**.
- Only **unvested** equity should be subject to clawback or repurchase.
