Ah, got it—you’re putting in the sweat, and you want to make sure you actually get what you’re owed and don’t get cut out later. Here’s what to look out for to protect yourself when agreeing to a sweat equity arrangement:

Key Things to Watch Out For:
1. Clear Vesting Terms
Insist on a written vesting schedule. For example: 25% after 12 months, then monthly vesting over 3 years.

Avoid vague milestones like “when the product launches” unless it’s clearly defined who’s responsible for what.

2. Define Your Role and Deliverables
Get it in writing: what you’ll do, how long you’ll be involved, and what qualifies as fulfilling your part.

Be specific—don’t leave your contributions open to interpretation.

3. Ownership Documentation
Ask for a cap table or a document showing you’re entitled to X% of the company.

Ideally, get a signed agreement or stock grant with your name, number of shares/units, and vesting terms.

4. Termination and Exit Clause
Make sure there’s no “at will” clause that allows them to fire you for nothing and take back your shares.

If they must terminate you, you should retain vested shares.

5. Reverse Vesting vs. Clawback
Reverse vesting is fine—it just means shares are issued upfront but can be taken back if you leave early.

Clawbacks should be limited—they shouldn't be able to take back already vested shares.

6. Valuation Clarity
Know the current valuation of the company, or agree on a “fair market value” if they ever buy back your shares.

Don’t accept $0.01/share buybacks unless that’s really the value and you're not getting shafted.

7. Legal Entity and Agreements
Make sure the company is legally formed (LLC, C-corp, etc.) and can legally issue equity.

No promises without paper. If it’s not written and signed, it doesn’t exist.
