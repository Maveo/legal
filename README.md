# 🛠️ Sweat Equity Survival Guide

A quick checklist and survival guide for anyone contributing time and skills in exchange for equity in a startup or project.

---

## 🔍 What to Look Out For

### ✅ 1. Company Structure – Can it Issue Shares?
- Only certain legal business types can offer real equity.
- Make sure the entity is (or will be) able to legally grant you ownership.
- If it’s not yet registered, push for formal setup before promises of equity.

### ✅ 2. Clear Vesting Schedule

#### For long-term projects:
- Common setup: **4 years with a 1-year cliff**

#### For short-term projects (e.g. 1–6 months):
Use **milestone-based vesting**, tied to actual project delivery:

| **Milestone** | **Description**                             | **Timeline**  | **Equity Vested** |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| M1           | Basic system architecture delivered         | Week 1        | 10%                |
| M2           | Core feature set developed                  | Week 2        | 15%                |
| M3           | First version deployed for internal use     | Week 3–4      | 25%                |
| M4           | Iterations based on feedback                | Week 5        | 25%                |
| M5           | Handoff & documentation                     | Week 6        | 25%                |

> ✅ Vesting happens *as each milestone is confirmed completed*, not just over time.

### ✅ 3. Define Your Role and Deliverables
- Clarify what you’re actually doing (e.g. “backend developer”, “product design”, etc.)
- List your deliverables in writing
- Be specific: What tech stack? What parts of the product? What defines “done”?

### ✅ 4. Get It In Writing
- Ask for a **Shareholders’ Agreement**, **Letter of Intent (LoI)**, or **Sweat Equity Agreement**.
- Key things it should include:
  - Your % ownership
  - Vesting terms
  - Buyback or exit clauses
  - What happens if either party leaves

### ✅ 5. Protect Your Vested Shares
- If you leave or are let go, **vested shares should remain yours**.
- Only **unvested** equity should be subject to clawback or repurchase.
